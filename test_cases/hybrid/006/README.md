# Test Case 007

Test case for when a feed-forward neural network sets one of the model parameters, with one of the inputs to the network being a parameter that is estimated. Since the network is not a part of the ODE model's right-hand side (RHS), it should only be evaluated once per likelihood computation for computational efficiency.

## Model Structure

The SBML model for this problem is given as:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d} \text{prey}}{\mathrm{d} t} = \alpha \cdot \text{prey} - \beta \cdot \text{prey} \cdot \text{predator} $$

$$\frac{\mathrm{d} \text{predator}}{\mathrm{d} t} = \gamma \cdot \text{prey} \cdot \text{predator} - \delta \cdot \text{predator}$$

## Data-Driven Model Structure

`N` is a feed-forward neural network with the following specification:

| LayerID | Layer                                                  | Activation Function |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| layer1  | Linear(in_features = 2, out_features = 5, bias = true) | tanh                |
| layer2  | Linear(in_features = 5, out_features = 5, bias = true) | tanh                |
| layer3  | Linear(in_features = 5, out_features = 1, bias = true) | identity            |

The inputs to the network are provided by the `input1` and `input2`, where `input2` is notably a parameter that is estimated, and appears in the ODE.
